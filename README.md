# An-LLM-Augmented-Knowledge-Graph-System-for-E-commerce-Insights

# Project Description:
Dataset 1: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset
Dataset 2: Pulseun.csv

Developed an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates a knowledge graph to enhance natural language querying and insight generation in the e-commerce domain.

Utilized the Amazon Sales Dataset from Kaggle, comprising over 100,000 structured records detailing product information, ratings, and reviews, to construct the foundational elements of the knowledge graph.

Incorporated unstructured customer chat logs, totaling approximately 50,000 entries, to enrich the knowledge graph with real-world conversational data, capturing nuanced customer sentiments and inquiries.

Engineered a pipeline leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from both structured and unstructured data sources, facilitating the dynamic construction of a comprehensive knowledge graph using Neo4j.

Implemented a mechanism where natural language queries are translated into Cypher queries via the LLM, enabling dynamic and context-aware retrieval of information from the knowledge graph.

Enhanced the knowledge graph by incorporating inferred relationships and patterns suggested by the LLM, ensuring a richer and more interconnected dataset for analysis.

Delivered a system capable of providing explainable and actionable insights, such as product recommendations and sales trends, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in e-commerce operations.
